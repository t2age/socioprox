Smart Device
------------

You need to copy these 2 html file to the smartdevice
that you want to use to stablish the connection/link...

Copy both, place them in any folder, then:

If you want to be the Peer A, run the tta.html...

If you want to be the Peer B, run the ttb.html...

You need to open the file with Firefox Mobile...
Chrome browser does not work!


Desktop PC or Raspberry
-----------------------
On desktop PCs and SBC, you can also use Chrome or Chromium...

Just remember that, on Raspberry PI, Firefox DOES NOT work,
it DOES NOT support WebRTC...

Also, the code should work OK on Electron (PC, PI, SBC, etc)...
